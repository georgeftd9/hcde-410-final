    "## Motivation and Problem Statement:\n",
    "I did this research mainly because I wanted to explore the social factors that cause stroke. Many uncomfortable symptoms that occur in humans, except for congenital disease factors, are caused by external interference. For example, fever may be due to wearing too little in the cold winter. But besides being sick, headaches may also be caused by high work pressure, getting older, or mental illness caused by unsatisfactory life (marital discord). According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. Perhaps through the exploration of social factors, non-pharmacological treatments can be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a human-centered perspective, the concept of three-point poisoning of drugs has been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Why not use non-drugs to solve physical discomfort symptoms? At the same time, perhaps we can help people around us to get rid of the trouble of stroke from the conclusions of the research. I hope I can learn how to handle data correctly from this research and have a better understanding of the current social situation."

    "In addition to the physical factors that may cause stroke, such as high blood pressure and heart disease mentioned in this dataset, it also includes some social factors such as single status, job type, living location, and some personal information such as BMI value and whether smokes. This dataset fits the original intention of my motivation. Even though the total amount of this data table is only more than 5000, but the data covers a wide range, I believe this dataset can be used as the basis of thick data."
